# ideas

- a key value store with a rest interface
- the bike fit thing has become a domain modeling exercise that i'm not terribly into at the moment.
- a REST s-expr calculator parser
- something with database access?

I think it would be most enlightening to go with the first. start with in-memory, move to a database.

okay, sold?
